**MythicKey** is a World of Warcraft addon designed to enhance the **Mythic+ dungeon experience**. The addon focuses on automating key mechanics and improving dungeon coordination through optimized features. Future expansions will include integration with **GobLib**, providing advanced API functionalities such as the **Mythic+ Key Announcer**.

## Features

The core reasons for developing **MythicKey** were:

- **üîë Automatic Keystone Insertion**: Optimized for performance and stability, this feature detects and inserts your Mythic+ Keystone automatically when opening the Mythic+ UI, ensuring minimal impact on game performance and avoiding Lua errors.

- **‚úÖ Ready Check System**: Initiates a ready check as soon as the keystone is inserted to ensure all party members are prepared.

- **‚è≥ Pre-Pull Countdown** *(Planned Feature)*: After the ready check, a short countdown will notify the group before the dungeon starts, allowing Demon Hunters and others to prepare.

- **üì¢ Mythic+ Key Announcer** *(Planned Feature as part of GobLib API)*: Announces your Mythic+ key to the group chat automatically when acquired, when a dungeon is completed, and when accepting a Mythic+ key from LFG for reference. This feature can be toggled on/off and will post only the key received from the leader (key host) to reduce unnecessary spam.

- **‚è≥ Mythic+ Timer (Planned Feature): Provides an in-game timer to help players track and optimize their Mythic+ dungeon run**.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Debugging** *(Planned)*: Features will be moved to the new **GobLib** library, allowing modular settings and debugging options.

## Development Vision

The idea for **MythicKey** originated during *Legion*. While similar concepts may have emerged independently, this addon was designed from the ground up with a focus on **performance optimization** and **expandability**. Unlike WeakAuras, which can be challenging to maintain and extend, **MythicKey** is built to be both lightweight and adaptable, reducing performance overhead while avoiding Lua errors.

## Disclaimer

This addon was independently developed, and while similar ideas may exist, **MythicKey** was designed from the ground up with a focus on performance efficiency and stability. The **Mythic+ Key Announcer** feature was inspired by [runningbird‚Äôs Mythic-Plus-Key-Announcer](https://github.com/runningbird/Mythic-Plus-Key-Announcer), but **MythicKey** is a standalone project with no direct affiliation or endorsement from runningbird or **HydraAddons**, the creator of [AutoKeystone](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autokeystone). Unlike standalone announcers, **MythicKey** integrates multiple M+ functionalities into a single addon, reducing the need for multiple separate addons. Additionally, this feature enhances the **Automatic Keystone Insertion** by integrating a **Ready Check System**, ensuring the group is prepared immediately after the keystone is placed.
